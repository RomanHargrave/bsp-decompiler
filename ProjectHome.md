Google Code is shutting down, so this repository has been moved to GitHub! The new repository can be found here: https://github.com/MofoMan2000/bsp-decompiler Any new changes or updates will be committed to the new repository only. I'll leave the Google Code page up for as long as Google is willing to maintain it, to allow the downloads page to continue distributing.

A decompiler for almost any BSP format. Originally written for James Bond 007: NightFire in Java and recently ported to C#.

Supported engines include:
Quake 2
Quake 3 (and many games based on it, including Star Trek Elite Force 2 and American McGee's Alice)
Source (including Vindictus and Tactical Intervention)
Doom/Doom 2/Heretic/Hexen

Supports output to:
GTK Radiant MAP
Hammer VMF
GearCraft MAP
MoH Radiant MAP
DoomEdit MAP

Support for some features is preliminary or nonexistant. Work continues, but lack of documentation and difficulty of reverse engineering some file formats makes things slow.
